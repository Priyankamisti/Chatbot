# Chatbot
This is a chatbot which I created using python program
import time 
now = time.ctime()
question = {
       "hi": "Hello",
       "how are you" : "I am fine. And you?",
       "i am fine" : "Good",
       "i am good. Thank you." : "Good",
       "What is your name?" : "My name is Jarvis.",
       "How old are you" : "I am 20 years old."
       "What should I eat for dinner today?" : "Maybe something fulfiling and good",
       "What is the time now?" : now,
       }
while True:
   qs = input()
   if (qs == "quit"):
       break
   else:
       print(question[qs])
